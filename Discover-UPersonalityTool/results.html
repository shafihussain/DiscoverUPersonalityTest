Browns usually enjoy leading and being up front with people by expressing themselves openly and directly. Builders are practical people who will build a home, a school, a gang, a nation, a religion, a corporation, or an empire. Tradition and patriotism are part of a Builder’s life. Builders want the bottom line. They do not like it when others are not direct with them. Builders want to be the best at everything they do.</p>

They know the underlying details are important and they make sure that everything is brought into consideration before making an important decision. Planners are prone to do a lot of personal thinking. They want to cover all the details as a constant tumbling of ideas takes place in their minds. Planners are visionaries, but usually are not very practical. Planners will miss opportunities because they are too slow at getting things done.</p>

Relaters want unity with others and are usually romantic at heart. They are sympathetically mature and want to communicate and socialize with others. Emotional intimacy is a must in any relationship.</p>
